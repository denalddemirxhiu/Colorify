### Breadboarding Milestone
  At this point the Raspberry Pi was hooked up to the sensor via jumper wires. Below are the images that provide proof that the Raspberry Pi was connected to the sensor and it recognized the sensor using the i2cdetect command.
  The sensor was connected to the Rasberry Pi using the following pins:  
- PIN 1 (3.3V) - connected to 3.3 V pin in the sensor with an orange jumper wire  
- PIN 3 (SDA1) - connected to SDA pin in the sensor with a blue jumper wire  
- PIN 5 (SCL1) - connected to the SCL pin in the sensor with a brown jumper wire  
- PIN 6 (GND) - connected to the GND pin in the sensor with a black jumper wire

### Project Schedule Update
  We just finished the Breadboarding milestone which shows that based on the project planned schedule I am currently on schedule. For the moment I am working to create the diagram for the PCB in Fritzing which should be completed by next week. As soon as I get the PCB design completed I will send the files to Vlad and Kelly in the Prototype Lab (J233). The project schedule can be viewed [here](https://github.com/denalddemirxhiu/Colorify/blob/master/Documentation/Capstone%20Gantt%20Schedule.mpp)
  
### Budget Update
  Currently there are no changes to the budget, except for the parts that have arrived. All the parts that I ordered have arrived and I am not planning to buy any extra parts. The project budget can be viewed [here](https://github.com/denalddemirxhiu/Colorify/blob/master/Documentation/Colorify%20Budget.xlsx) 

### Resources used to wire and connect to the sensor
  - Raspberry Solutions website that shows the pinout of the Raspberry Pi 3B+ can be found [here](https://www.raspberry-solutions.com/connect-sensor-to-raspberry-pi/)  
  - Sparkfun guide that shows the step by step tutorial on how to hookup the ISL29125 sensor can be found [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/isl29125-rgb-light-sensor-hookup-guide/hardware-overview)
